## Background

**Pitch**

Job tracker is a way to track progress on multiple job sites amongst multiple workers. The employee will be able to create a "invoice tracking report" for the job they work on for that specific day/week. This report will contain a form of sorts that takes in the customers "tracking number", the building name and number(maybe the address as well) and asks which floor was worked on, how many units were on the floor, and how many outlets per room.

The job tracker number is auto-created by the system
A description box (per floor) is there to provide additional information about the project
A picture upload space as well to provide context from the description(per unit)

This tool will be used by the employee (builder) to prove their work to management, to receive payment. The management can use the provided information in any way they see fit.

~~There may be an additional text box that will be present that that employee can type in to provide timeline projections, estimations and any other relevant information for management to be aware of.~~
